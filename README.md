This repository is a project using Python and SQLAlchemy ORM queries to explore and analyze the data in a climate database in order to help with trip planning for a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii.  A Flask API app was also created based on the SQL ORM queries.  

A query was created to find precipitation for the last year of data and the results were saved in a Pandas DataFrame, sorted by date.  A line chart was created from the Pandas DataFrame.  Summary statics were printed for the precipitation data using Pandas.  Queries were also created to find the most active stations and answer the question of which station had the greatest number of observations.  And finally, queries were created to find the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for the most active station, and to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation.  The temperature data was used to plot a histogram.

Included in the repository is a README file, and a directory named SurfsUp that contains a Jupyter Notebook file named climate_starter with all of the code for the plots, DataFrames, and statistical analysis of temperature and precipitation data from the various stations.  Also included in the SurfsUp directory is a Python file containing the code for the Flask API app, and a Resources folder containing two CSV files with station and climate data respectively, and a SQLite database file used to reflect tables into the SQLAlchemy ORM.
